# About this project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This is a simple example of an ecommerce platform. Some of the additional libraries used in this project are: [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/), [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/). Also to mention that the icons and the typography were imported/downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

## About the caching

Everytime the list or a product information is requested from the Frontend, first the local storage will be checked if a existent piece of data was stored there. If it's empty, this data will be fetched from an API and then stored (in the browsers local storage) if the request is successful. Also a timestamp will be stored, in order to update this stored data after 1 hour (if another request is made to the same endpoint).

### What about the cart quantity?

This piece of data is also stored in the browser local storage, but for being able to persist it on the Frontend side, a React Context is being used. So if the quantity changes, the number showed in the header can be refreshed automatically.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
